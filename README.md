# romiRevised
An updated version of Romi, and a better oganization of systems.

The intent of this code is to:
  - learn to better handle sensors for PID control
  - learn better planning from a software enginneering perspective
      - make testable functions that can be unit testing
      - make a code base to allow for unit testing of aurdiuno code and object sensors
          - create methods simular to:
              - assert true
              - assert false
 - how to abstract basic functions
 - keep my code well organized and ready for manipulation
